# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version : 3.0.0

* System dependencies

* Configuration: run `budle install` at the root. Once complete `cd client` and `npm install`

* Database creation/initialization: run `rails db:migrate` at the root. Start server `rails s -p 3001`

* Launch the app: `cd client` and `npm start`

* How to run the test suite: rspec coming soon
